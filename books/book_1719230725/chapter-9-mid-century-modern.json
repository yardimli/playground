This beat explores how the functionalism and minimalism of Bauhaus merged with new materials and manufacturing techniques, giving birth to Mid-Century Modern design. We examine how designers like Charles and Ray Eames started experimenting with molded plywood and fiberglass, setting the stage for a new era of accessible, mass-produced furniture that would define the aesthetic of the 1950s and 60s."

We explore how Wright's organic approach to architecture, while predating the Mid-Century Modern movement, significantly influenced its development. The beat examines Fallingwater's seamless integration with nature, its innovative use of cantilevers, and its open plan interior - all elements that would become hallmarks of Mid-Century Modern architecture. We discuss how Wright's work bridged the gap between earlier modernist ideas and the more organic, human-centered approach of Mid-Century Modern design."
