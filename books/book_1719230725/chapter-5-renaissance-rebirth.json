Elaborate fan vaults and intricate tracery reach their zenith in structures like King's College Chapel in Cambridge. However, a new wind is blowing from Italy, carrying with it the seeds of the Renaissance. Artists and architects begin to look back to classical antiquity for inspiration, setting the stage for a dramatic shift in design philosophy."
