World-building:

Go over the Beat Text and update or add to the existing Lore Book with the new information. Focus on things such as character development and world-building. Only add content that adds value to the story. Do not add filler content. If content has not changed, copy from the Existing Lore Book. Keep in mind that the Existing Lore Book will be discarded so this New Lore Book needs everything from the old one.
